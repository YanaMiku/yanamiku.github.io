## About Me
Hello — I’m Yana (GitHub: `YanaMiku`) — a passionate web creator focused on clean, accessible HTML-first pages and delightful front-end experiences. I love turning ideas into lightweight, fast, and beautiful web projects.

- 🔭 I’m currently building and refining my portfolio site and static web experiments.
- 🌱 I enjoy learning progressive enhancement, accessibility, and performance optimizations.
- 💬 Ask me about building semantic HTML, content-first design, and polishing small interactions.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I prefer tiny, maintainable code over large frameworks when it makes sense.

## What I Do
- Build semantic, accessible HTML pages and content-driven micro-sites.
- Prototype UI with performance and simplicity first.
- Improve content structure for better SEO and reading experience.
- Collaborate on small web projects and community documentation.

## Core Skills
- HTML (semantic structure, microformats, accessibility)
- CSS (layout fundamentals, responsive patterns)
- Basic JavaScript (progressive enhancement)
- Content design & information architecture
- Performance-minded front-end approaches

(If you want badges for each skill, I can add visually-stylized ones or a skills grid.)

## How I Work
- Start with content: structure HTML for meaning and clarity.
- Make it accessible: keyboard-first, ARIA where needed, readable markup.
- Optimize: keep bundles small, defer non-essential assets, prefer native capabilities.
- Iterate: usability testing, feedback loops, and incremental improvements.
